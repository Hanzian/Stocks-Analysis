# **Stocks-Analysis**

  ## **Overview of the project**
  
   ### **Background**
   
Steve would like help from his friend Data Analyst for a relevant analysis of his parents' investment in green energy stocks. For this we used VBA to automate the analysis and allow Steve to use it in the future.
We started by creating a worksheet to analyse the list of stocks, their daily volume and annual returns (the percentage difference between the price at the end of the year and that of the beginning of the year).
Also we used conditional formatting to facilitate analysis.
Finally, we inserted a code allowing us to calculate the execution time of a code.
    
   ### **Purpose of  project**
        
Steve wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Thus, the purpose of this project is to refactor the code to allow for a large dataset to be analyzed in an efficient amount of time. The refactored code will loop through all the data only one time to output the total volume and yearly return.
